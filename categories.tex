\section{Categorizing Verified-programming Tools}\label{S:categories}

I propose 3 axes along which to classify the tools used to verify programs.
These are
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the type of interaction;
    \item the type of proof logic; and
    \item the type of supported programming languages.
\end{enumerate}

I examine each in turn in Sections~\ref{S:t_interaction},~\ref{S:t_logic},
and~\ref{S:t_pl}.

One might also include the logic of the underlying verifier, especially in cases
where it differs from the proof logic. I choose not to because in the cases I
have studied they are the same (\eg, a Coq program proven in Coq~\cite{Coq}),
one is encoded in the other (\eg, a Dafny~\cite{leino2010dafny} program proven
by translation to Boogie~\cite{Barnett_2006,leino2008this}), or one is not
relevant to the other (\eg, proofs in Iris's logic~\cite{Jung_2018b} use Iris's
proof rules, while Iris is built on Coq). The programmer tasked with writing the
proof is concerned with the logic of the proof-system and the proof to be
written, except in the hopefully rare case of leaky
abstractions~\cite{Spolsky_2002}.

\subsection{Type of Interaction}\label{S:t_interaction}

\emph{TODO does \texttt{paragraph} or \texttt{subsubsection} work better?}

By ``interaction'' I mean that between the programmer and the verifier: what is
necessary to formulate proofs? Borrowing the terminology of~\cite[\S 2]{Nelson_2019},
I dissect this axis into 3 major types of interaction:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Interactive,
    \item Auto-active, and
    \item Automatic (sometimes called ``push-button'').
\end{enumerate}

For each type the referenced~\cite{Nelson_2019} provides a plethora of further
examples.

\paragraph{Interactive verification.} This is the model employed by interactive
theorem-provers and proof-assistants such as Coq~\cite{Coq},
Isabelle~\cite{Isabelle}, and HOL~\cite{HOL}. The programmer, having written
programs and specifications, states theorems relating them (or lemmata,
corollaries, \etc, as the case may be). In order to prove the statements, the
programmer interacts directly with the system in a sort of call-and-response.
The verifier presents a goal: prove this statement. The programmer can execute
tactics to manipulate the goal, introduce quantified variables and hypothesis,
and otherwise make progress towards the proof of the goal. The verifier
represents the effect of these executions with another response, \eg, prove this
statement in this context. The programmer continues this dialogue with the
verifier, perhaps walking backwards and trying a different approach or walking
forwards through the steps of the proof, until the verifier has been given a
complete proof of all necessary goals.

Such systems may support automation in the sense of tactics that invoke other
tactics based on the goal or context; these can range from proof searches to
constraint solvers over linear integer arithmetic to manipulations necessary to
hide details of the underlying logical system.

\paragraph{Auto-active verification.} The approach taken by systems like
Dafny~\cite{leino2010dafny}. The programmer annotates code both with
specifications and proof hints, such as pre- or post- conditions or loop
invariants. The verifier translates the source into a verification condition and
uses a constraint solver to finish the verification. Some systems, such as
Dafny, permit annotations that rise nearly to the level of proof texts like
those of interactive verification, with composable theorems and lemmata in
addition to functional specifications and standard annotations. While writing
the proofs, though, the current state of the  goal and proof context are often
hidden or implicit, since they are being translated for the constraint
solver\footnote{The original goal and context are of course visible in the
original statement being proven.}. A call-and-response effort is possible in
such systems to complete a proof, but a major challenge is to discover what the
automatic part of the system cannot prove and actively provide effective hints
to make progress. One power of this type of system is to free the programmer
from all the details of the proof; the verifier often can handle simple
statements on its own, while more complex statements can be proven with only a
few well-directed hints. On the other hand, discovering which hints to use is
like a game of ``20 Questions''\footnote{The programmer asks ``Would you be
able to make progress on the proof if I could convince you of \(P\)?'' Based on
the verifier's response, which is essentially ``yes'' or ``no'', a sub-proof of
\(P\) is given through hints or not, and the game continues. The summer course
in~\cite{Kapritsos_2020} provides a detailed look at this style of proof in
Dafny.}, and the resulting proofs can be difficult to read.

\paragraph{Automatic verification.} The approach taken by
Rosette~\cite{Torlak_2013}. An automatic verifier restricts the class of
properties and programs that be verified in order to fully automate the process.
The essential limit is finitization: finite specifications that can be
implemented without unbounded loops allows symbolic evaluation or execution to
generate constraints that can be handed off to a solver, much like in
auto-active verification. The developer thus programs in such a restricted
system and pushes the ``verify button'', invoking the symbolic evaluator and
constraint solver. The limitations allow a greater degree of automation than in
the previous cases, leading to the descriptor ``push-button verification''---no
proof annotations are necessary. Such systems have been used to build
surprisingly sophisticated programs given the finitization requirement; examples
include the Yggdrasil file-system~\cite{Sigurbjarnarson_2016} and the
Hyperkernel OS~\cite{Nelson_2017}.

A related challenge is exponential path explosion: symbolic evaluation may have
to consider a rapidly-growing number of symbolic paths while generating
constraints. Rosette takes steps to solve this via aggressive partial
evaluation~\cite{Torlak_2013,Torlak_2014}, lenient symbolic
execution~\cite{Chang_2018}, and
profiling~\cite{Bornholt_2018,Porncharoenwase_2020}. Also related, as in the
case of auto-active verification, is the challenge of communicating back to the
developer the meaning of the results in the program domain.

\subsection{Type of Proof Logic}\label{S:t_logic}

A full account of proof-logics for programs would be a long paper in its own
right and is out of scope for this report. Look no further than
\figurename~\ref{F:iris_complex} to see how complicated the topology of (a
subset of) proof-logics can be. Instead, I will mention a key proof-logic
(namely, Hoare logic) and some of its extensions. For another mention of
program- and proof- logics and their uses, see~\cite[\S 5]{Appel_2011}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/iris_2_0_concurrent_logics}
    \caption{A figure from a presentation on Iris~\cite{Jung_2016_slides}
    depicting the relationship of many concurrent separation logics developed
    specially for a system or proof. Iris notably attempts to distill these
    logics to their core, providing a system inside of which any of the
    individual logics may be derived.}\label{F:iris_complex}
\end{figure}

All proof-logics for programs combine a set of logic-rules with the semantics of
the program's language. In the simplest case, the programmer combines
``regular'' logic (in the sense of \gls{coc} or ZFC) with the semantics to write
proofs about program equivalences, termination, and transformations.
\emph{Software Foundations} shows it's possible to prove interesting
meta-theoretic\footnote{``meta'' because they are ``properties of the language
as a whole, rather than of particular programs''~\cite{Pierce:SF2}. It is also
possible to prove claims about specific programs this way, but, at least in some
systems, this becomes unwieldy.} claims about a language using these techniques
in their discussions about \emph{Simple Imperative Programs}~\cite{Pierce:SF1}
and \emph{Program Equivalence}~\cite{Pierce:SF2} and provides an introduction to
such proofs. Essentially, standard reasoning rules about logic formulae are
combined with the inference rules that define the semantics. An example is
provided in \figurename~\ref{F:Imp_ex}. I refer
to~\cite{Winskel_1993,Harper_2016} for introductions to program semantics.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c}
        E-APlus \\
        \(e_1 \to n_1\) \quad \(e_2 \to n_2\) \\
        \midrule
        \(e_1 +_e e_2 \to n_1 + n_2\) \\

        \\

        E-Seq \\
        \((c_1, s_1) \To s_2\) \quad \((c_2, s_2) \To s_3\) \\
        \midrule
        \((c_1;c_2, s_1) \To s_3\)
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Sample inference rules for \texttt{Imp}, a simple imperative
    language. E-APlus shows how to add two arithmetic expressions, where \(\to\)
    means ``evaluates to.'' Similarly, E-Seq shows how to sequence two
    statements \(c_1, c_2\), where \((c, s)\) represents a pair of a statement
    and a state and \((c, s) \To s'\) means ``evaluating statement \(c\) in
    state \(s\) produces the new state \(s'\).''}\label{F:Imp_ex}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Hoare Logic}

When turning to program verification\footnote{Recall \citeauthor{EWD:EWD1036}'s
act of proving a program implements its specification.}, \emph{Software
Foundations} introduces Hoare logic. Hoare logic, with its many variations, is
the predominant proof-logic for program verification. Originating in
\citeyear{Hoare_1969} with \citeauthor{Hoare_1969}'s paper~\cite{Hoare_1969},
Hoare logic formalizes the notion of pre- and post-conditions with the
\emph{Hoare triple}, written

\begin{equation*}
    \{P\} C \{Q\},
\end{equation*}

to indicate that command \(C\) has pre-condition \(P\) and post-condition
\(Q\), both assertions (\eg, a claim about the current state). If \(P\) is
established, executing \(C\) establishes \(Q\) (or \(C\) diverges). The
programmer indicates that \(C\) diverges in a Hoare triple by choosing \(Q =
\bot\). Hoare logic permits reasoning about partial correctness; termination
must be proven separately\footnote{Various sources claim it is possible to give
rules for total correctness.}. The statement of the triple can thus be written
using notation from \figurename~\ref{F:Imp_ex}, and assuming \(P\) and \(Q\) are
functions from states to propositions

\begin{align*}
    \{P\} C \{Q\} \definedas \forall s, s' : &(C, s) \To s' &\text{if \(C\) terminates} \\
    &\implies P s &\text{and if \(P s\) holds} \\
    &\implies Q s' &\text{then we can establish \(Q s'\) holds.}
\end{align*}

This is a model-theoretic Hoare logic: the proof-rules are stated in the terms
of the model. Hoare logic can also be defined in proof-theory; this is arguably
more common~\cite[Ch. \emph{Hoare Logic as a Logic}]{Pierce:SF2}. Such a
statement avoids ascribing direct meaning to Hoare triples and instead gives
syntactic derivation rules. These rules are the same judgements as in the
model-theoretic definition, and the two are consistent with each other.

Reasoning with Hoare logic mimics the structure of the program,
as triples can be effectively combined to build up claims about the entire
program. The rules for doing so resemble those of ``regular'' logic formulae
above, with some connectives for strengthening pre-conditions or weakening
post-conditions. Formalizations and uses of these rules often work backwards;
the natural way to construct a Hoare logic proof is to start at the final
post-condition and move backwards to the beginning. A selection of rules are
presented in \figurename~\ref{F:Hoare_ex}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c}
        Hoare-Consequence-Pre \\
        \(\{P'\} C \{Q\}\) \quad \(P \TO P'\) \\
        \midrule
        \(\{P\} C \{Q\}\) \\

        \\

        Hoare-Seq \\
        \(\{P\} C_1 \{Q\}\) \quad \(\{Q\} C_2 \{R\}\) \\
        \midrule
        \(\{P\} C_1;C_2 \{R\}\)
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Two examples of the rules of Hoare logic. Hoare-Consequence-Pre
    captures the notion that we can strengthen the pre-condition from \(P'\) to
    \(P\) and still have a valid triple (\(\TO\) is analogous to implication,
    with the definition \(\forall s: P s \implies P' s\)). Hoare-Seq provides an
    analogue to E-Seq from \figurename~\ref{F:Imp_ex}. The programmer composes
    rules like these rather than invoking the definition of a Hoare triple
    whenever possible, using a higher level of abstraction.}\label{F:Hoare_ex}
\end{figure}

I should note that Hoare logics are mostly seen for imperative programming
languages. (\emph{TODO what about functional languages? Rust is nearly
functional, but \(\lambda_{\text{Rust}}\) from RustBelt uses a CPS-style
\(\lambda\)-calculus combined with CSL in Iris?})

\subsubsection{Pre-, post-, and weakest conditions}

The choice of pre- and post- conditions is up to the programmer, who wants to
prove that the program implements a spec \(\var{Spec}\). A natural choice for
the post-condition is some \(Q\) that implies \(\var{Spec}\). Similarly, a
natural choice for the pre-condition is some \(P\), possibly corresponding to
constraints on the program inputs, and that also allows the programmer to prove
\(\{P\} C \{Q\}\). Then we can claim that if \(C\) terminates under
pre-conditions \(P\) then \(P \implies C \models \var{Spec}\).

The programmer could also choose \(P = \bot\), in which case any post-condition
at all is valid, including the \(Q\) that entails \(\var{Spec}\) from earlier
(check the definition of the triple, and observe that this is a case of the
principle of explosion). But this ridiculous pre-condition is never satisfied,
so in practice we have proven nothing about \(C\), except that if it terminates
any behavior whatsoever is allowed!

In a similar vein, we can always add extraneous information to the pre-condition
which is not used; this does not necessarily invalidate our proof in the same
way, but such information may not be needed.

To prevent such absurd pre-conditions as \(\bot\) and to streamline their
generation, many systems make use of ``weakest
pre-conditions''~\cite{dijkstra1976discipline,Nelson_1989} (cited
in~\cite{leino2008specification}). The intuitive idea is that for some statement
\(C\) and some post-condition \(Q\) we denote by \(\wpre{C, Q}\) the ``minimal''
information we need to correctly establish \(Q\), \ie, such that the triple
\(\{\wpre{C,Q}\} C \{Q\}\) is provable. The programmer must still choose an
appropriate \(Q\) to establish \(\var{Spec}\); the generation of the required
pre-conditions can now be automated. Note that this does not mean the proof will
be straightforward with \emph{only} these pre-conditions! The programmer may
need to make logical leaps to strengthen conditions as necessary, particularly
where complex algebraic reasoning is required.

Formally, \(P\) is a weakest pre-condition with respect to \(C\) and \(Q\) iff
\begin{equation*}
    \{P\} C \{Q\} \text{ and } \forall P', \{P'\} C \{Q\} \implies (P' \TO P).
\end{equation*}

The function \(\func{wp}\) is computable by structural induction on
\(C\). Crucially, it is not a decidability function; it returns a proposition,
not a proof. An extended example is found in~\cite[\S 3]{leino2008specification},
where weakest pre-conditions provide the vehicle used to translate from
Dafny~\cite{leino2010dafny} to Boogie~\cite{Barnett_2006,leino2008this}.

\subsubsection{Separation Logic}

According to~\cite[\S 5]{Appel_2011}, ``Ordinary Hoare logics have difficulty
with pointers and arrays, especially with updates of fields and array slots.''
To solve this problem, \citeauthor{Reynolds} invented \emph{separation
logic}~\cite{Reynolds}.

The crucial extension is to differentiate between the assertion \(P \land Q\),
which denotes that both conjuncts hold on the current state, and the assertion
\(P * Q\), which denotes that each conjunct holds on a disjoint part of the
current state. In other words, the state \(s\) can be split into \(s_1, s_2\)
(often written \(s = s_1 \uplus s_2\)) such that \(P\) holds on \(s_1\) and
\(Q\) holds on \(s_2\). Along with rules for manipulating this new separating
conjunction, the programmer gains the ability to reason about separate parts of
the store or state.

Other important rules in separation logics correspond to framing (as in
``framing the world'', not ``stack frames'') and address and pointer manipulation.

\subsubsection{Concurrent Separation Logic}

For reasoning about concurrency, Hoare logic and separation logic remained
inadequate; \citeauthor{O_Hearn_2007} proposed a \emph{concurrent separation
logic} to solve the problem~\cite{O_Hearn_2007}. \citeauthor{Brookes_2007}
provides a model in the companion paper~\cite{Brookes_2007}. Both papers discuss
the difficulty of soundness in such a logic---that, and the plethora of
subsequent separation and concurrent logics that have been developed
(\figurename~\ref{F:iris_complex}), each with their own complex rules,
demonstrate the difficulty both of developing and reasoning in a concurrent
separation logic. Reasoning about parallel programs may bring inherent
complexity to the problem. The various concurrent logics add rules required for
their specific uses, \eg, partial ownership or permissions in the case
of~\cite{Appel_2011}, which might require use of a separation algebra. Iris
carries these constructions to their limits, developing a foundational
separation algebra and parameterized logic that can be used to derive new
logics~\cite{Jung_2018b}.

One of the original concurrent separation logic proof rules
from~\cite{O_Hearn_2007} is presented in \figurename~\ref{F:CSL_ex}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c}
        \(\{P_1\} C_1 \{Q_1\}\) \quad \(\{P_2\} C_2 \{Q_2\}\) \\
        \midrule
        \(\{P_1 * P_2\} C_1 \parallel C_2 \{Q_1 * Q_2\}\)
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{A separation logic rule for reasoning about the concurrent
    execution of \(C_1\) and \(C_2\), denoted by \(\cdot \parallel \cdot\)
    from~\cite{O_Hearn_2007}.}\label{F:CSL_ex}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Type of Supported Programming Languages}\label{S:t_pl}

The supported languages are as varied as the programming language options
available to today's programmer, from MLs~\cite{Coq,Kumar_2014}, Lisps and
Schemes~\cite{Torlak_2013} to object-oriented
systems~\cite{leino2008specification,leino2010dafny} and bare-metal
assembly~\cite{Chlipala_2011} on top of which further abstractions can be
built~\cite{Chlipala_2015}. While this variety appears to present overwhelming
choice to the programmer who wishes to verify a program, reality belies a
simpler problem: some languages and design decisions are better suited to
certain problem domains than others. Correspondingly, certain proof logics are
better suited to certain domains, and one often finds pairings between language
and logic for the task at hand.

I recommend a few starting points for programmers seeking a particular language
style for their problems and discuss options available to those unsatisfied with
the existing languages.

The systems programmer is apt to look more towards C and Rust like systems; this
lends itself to a choice of tools like Bedrock~\cite{Chlipala_2011},
\gls{vst}~\cite{VST}, and CompCert~\cite{Kastner-LBSSF-2017}, possibly paired
with (concurrent) separation logic. Ynot~\cite{Nanevski08ynot:reasoning} is also
an option for those comfortable with monadic reasoning and Hoare logic.

Programmers in ML-like languages have Coq~\cite{Coq}, CakeML~\cite{Kumar_2014},
and similar tools to choose from; Lispers and Schemers look to both
relational-logic systems like Kanren~\cite{Byrd_2009} and automatic verifiers
like Rosette~\cite{Rosette}.

For the unsatisfied, Rosette promises the ability to build automatic
solver-aided languages suited to the problem at hand~\cite{Torlak_2013}. For
those seeking an auto-active style, the discussion
in~\cite{leino2008specification} offers a design for an object-oriented language
that could be adapted. When building a for a completely interactive environment,
building on top of existing systems is the norm. It is always possible to build
a compiler\footnote{or \emph{transpiler}, as some prefer} targeting a
higher-level verified language---the programmer thus has complete control of the
surface language, at the cost of building, maintaining, and perhaps verifying a
compiler. The ease of such an effort depends on how well the languages semantics
match; syntax is a matter of appropriate translation.
